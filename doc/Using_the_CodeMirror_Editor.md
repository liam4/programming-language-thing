# Using the CodeMirror Editor

I made a really simple online editor for PLT using [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/), which is amazing, by the way.

Simply open it up by clicking [here](http://liam4.github.io/programming-language-thing/codemirror/).

In order to use it you'll need to use a few keybinds:

* `cmd/ctrl enter`: run
* `cmd/ctrl s`: save

It uses local storage to save your project and does store one backup of your project when you exit the page, if you close it accidentally. There's only one save slot, so it's best to save your project to your hard drive somewhere.
